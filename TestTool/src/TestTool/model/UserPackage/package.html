User Package
</h3>
</a>

This package is for the user and account functionality of GalacTest. It contains the "UserDatabase" class, which stores a collection of users. These users are modeled by the "User" class. "Teacher" and "Student" are subclasses of "User" that account for the two different types of profiles there will be.
